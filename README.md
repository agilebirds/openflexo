openflexo
=========

The Openflexo infrastructure for collaborative modelling is a mature software suite aimed at building dedicated tools for multi-paradigm capture and analysis of information. The project originated as a business process modelling and analysis toolset, validated by numerous use cases in both IT services and industry over the course of 10 years. It has evolved into a highly adaptable toolbox, dedicated to supporting an original human-centric modelling methodology.  Building on a thorough analysis of its business partners' needs and academic research trends, the Openflexo team has developed an innovative vision for multi-paradigm modelling relying on a Model Federation approach. The current work on the technical infrastructure opens up a wide field of new opportunities for both: reinforcing its ability to address the wide range of use cases met by our business partners, motoring academic research in state of the art modelling techniques.  Openflexo has been made available as an OpenSource project in 2012, initiating a community-driven development process. Starting in 2013, the project will be supported by an innovative organization combining energies from both academia and the IT service industry. The core team will be hosted by a new kind of cooperative enterprise. Its mission: the coordination of an Open Innovation community, orchestrating the continuous improvement of the Openflexo modelling infrastructure.
