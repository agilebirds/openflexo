In addition, it will indicate that a Transaction Protocol Cancel message should be sent to any Entities involved in the Transaction.
doc_event_CANCEL_Intermediate=Intermediate event CANCEL\: This type of Intermediate Event is used within a Transaction Sub-Proc- ess. This type of Event MUST be attached to the boundary of a Sub- Process. It SHALL be triggered if a Cancel End Event is reached within the Transaction Sub-Process. It also SHALL be triggered if a Transaction Protocol \u201CCancel\u201D message has been received while the Transaction is being performed. Note that a Cancel Event always interrupts the Activity to which it is attached, i.e., there is not a non-interrupting version of this Event.

Thus, it is used to "throw" the Compensation Event, and the Event marker MUST be filled (see figure on the right). If an Activity is identified, and it was successfully completed, then that Activity will be compensated.
doc_event_COMPENSATION_Start=Start event COMPENSATION\: The Compensation Start Event is only allowed for triggering an in-line Compensation Event Sub-Process. This type of Event is triggered when compensation occurs.
doc_event_CONDITIONAL_Intermediate=Intermediate event CONDITIONAL\: This type of event is triggered when a Condition becomes true and interrupts the activity to which it is attached. A Condition is a type of Expression.

doc_event_LINK_Intermediate=Intermediate event CATCH LINK\: The Link Intermediate Events are only valid in Normal Flow, i.e. they may not be used on the boundary of an Activity. A Link is a mechanism for connecting two sections of a Process. Link Events can be used to create looping situations or to avoid long Sequence Flow lines. Link Event uses are limited to a single Process level (i.e., they cannot link a parent Pro- cess with a Sub-Process). Paired Intermediate Events can also be used as \u201COff-Page Connectors\u201D for printing a Process across multiple pages. They can also be used as generic \u201CGo To\u201D objects within the Process level. There can be multiple Source Link Events, but there can only be one Target Link Event.

doc_event_MESSAGE_Start=Start event MESSAGE\: A Message arrives from a Participant and triggers the start of the Process.
doc_event_MULTIPLEPARA_Intermediate=Intermediate event PARALLEL MULTIPLE\: Intermediate event PARALLEL MULTIPLE\: This means that there are multiple triggers assigned to the Event. If used within normal flow, the Event can only \u201Ccatch\u201D the trigger. When attached to the boundary of an activity, the Event can only \u201Ccatch\u201D the trigger. Unlike the normal Multiple Intermediate Event, all of the assigned trig- gers are required for the Event to be triggered.It interrupts the Activity to which it is attached.
doc_event_MULTIPLEPARA_NonInteruptive=Start event PARALLEL MULTIPLE non-interruptive\: This means that there are multiple triggers required before the Process can be instantiated without interrupting the containing process. All of the types of triggers that are listed in the Start Event MUST be triggered before the Process is instantiated.
doc_event_MULTIPLEPARA_NonInteruptiveBoundary=Intermediate event PARALLEL MULTIPLE non-interruptive\: Intermediate event PARALLEL MULTIPLE\: Intermediate event PARALLEL MULTIPLE\: This means that there are multiple triggers assigned to the Event. If used within normal flow, the Event can only \u201Ccatch\u201D the trigger. When attached to the boundary of an activity, the Event can only \u201Ccatch\u201D the trigger. Unlike the normal Multiple Intermediate Event, all of the assigned trig- gers are required for the Event to be triggered.It does not interrupt the Activity to which it is attached.
doc_event_MULTIPLEPARA_Start=Start event MULTIPLEPARA\: This means that there are multiple triggers required before the Process can be instantiated. All of the types of triggers that are listed in the Start Event MUST be triggered before the Process is instantiated.
doc_event_MULTIPLE_End=End event MULTIPLE\: This means that there are multiple consequences of ending the Process. All of them will occur (e.g., there might be multiple messages sent).
doc_event_MULTIPLE_Intermediate=Intermediate event CATCH MULTIPLE\: This means that there are multiple Triggers assigned to the Event. If used within normal flow, this event can \u201Ccatch\u201D the Triggers. When attached to the boundary of an activity, the Event can only \u201Ccatch\u201D the Trigger. In this case, only one of the assigned Triggers is required and the Event marker will be unfilled Upon being triggered, the Event that occurred will change the Normal Flow into an Exception Flow. It interrupts the Activity to which it is attached
doc_event_MULTIPLE_IntermediateDrop=Intermediate event THROW MULTIPLE\: This means that there are multiple Triggers assigned to the Event. If used within normal flow, this event can \u201Cthrow\u201D the Triggers. When used to \u201Cthrow\u201D the Trigger (the same as a Multiple End Event), all the assigned Triggers will be thrown.
doc_event_MULTIPLE_NonInteruptive=Start event MULTIPLE non-interruptive\: This means that there are multiple ways of triggering the Process. Only one of them is required without interrupting the containing process.
doc_event_MULTIPLE_NonInteruptiveBoundary=Intermediate event CATCH MULTIPLE non-interruptive\: When attached to the boundary of an activity, the Event can only \u201Ccatch\u201D the Trigger. In this case, only one of the assigned Triggers is required and the Event marker will be unfilled Upon being triggered, the Event that occurred will change the Normal Flow into an Exception Flow. It does not interrupt the activity it is attached to.
doc_event_MULTIPLE_Start=Start event MULTIPLE\: This means that there are multiple ways of triggering the Process. Only one of them is required.
doc_event_NONE_End=End event NONE\: ends the sub-process instance
doc_event_NONE_Intermediate=Intermidiate event NONE\: The None Intermediate Event is only valid in Normal Flow, i.e., it may not be used on the boundary of an Activity. Although there is no specific trig- ger for this Event, it is defined as throw Event. It is used for modeling methodologies that use Events to indicate some change of state in the Process.
doc_event_NONE_Start=Start event NONE\: a new sub-process instance is created
doc_event_SIGNAL_End=End event SIGNAL\: This type of End indicates that a Signal will be broadcasted when the End has been reached. Note that the Signal, which is broadcast to any Pro- cess that can receive the Signal, can be sent across Process levels or Pools, but is not a Message (which has a specific Source and Target).
doc_event_SIGNAL_Intermediate=Intermediate event CATCH SIGNAL\: This type of event is used for receiving Signals. interrupts the Activity to which it is attached. A Signal is for general communication within and across Process Levels, across Pools, and between Business Process Diagrams. A BPMN Signal is similar to a signal flare that shot into the sky for anyone who might be interested to notice and then react. Thus, there is a source of the Signal, but no specific intended target. This type of Intermediate Event can receive a Signal if the Event is part of a Normal Flow. The Event can only receive a Signal when attached to the boundary of an activity. The Signal Event differs from an Error Event in that the Signal defines a more general, non- error condition for interrupting activities (such as the successful comple- tion of another activity) as well as having a larger scope than Error Events.
doc_event_SIGNAL_IntermediateDrop=Intermediate event THROW SIGNAL\: This type of event is used for sending Signals. A Signal is for general communication within and across Process Levels, across Pools, and between Business Process Diagrams. A BPMN Signal is similar to a signal flare that shot into the sky for anyone who might be interested to notice and then react. Thus, there is a source of the Signal, but no specific intended target. This type of Intermediate Event can send a Signal if the Event is part of a Normal Flow. The Event can only receive a Signal when attached to the boundary of an activity. The Signal Event dif- fers from an Error Event in that the Signal defines a more general, non- error condition for interrupting activities (such as the successful comple- tion of another activity) as well as having a larger scope than Error Events.
doc_event_SIGNAL_NonInteruptive=Start event SIGNAL\: A Signal arrives that has been broadcast from another Process and trig- gers the start of the Process without interrupting the containing process. Note that the Signal is not a Message, which has a specific target for the Message. Multiple Processes can have Start Events that are triggered from the same broadcasted Signal.
doc_event_SIGNAL_NonInteruptiveBoundary=Intermediate event CATCH SIGNAL non-interruptive\: The Signal Event can only receive a Signal when attached to the bound- ary of an activity. In this context, it will change the Normal Flow into an Exception Flow upon being triggered. . It does not interrupt the Activity to which it is attached.
doc_event_SIGNAL_Start=Start event SIGNAL\: A Signal arrives that has been broadcast from another Process and trig- gers the start of the Process. Note that the Signal is not a Message, which has a specific target for the Message. Multiple Processes can have Start Events that are triggered from the same broadcasted Signal.
