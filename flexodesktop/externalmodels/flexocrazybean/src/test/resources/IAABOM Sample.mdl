|The REGISTRATION package makes it possible to define the existence of different types of official registrations and the role of each of these types of registration in the insurance business. 
|Registration represents the formal recording by an authorised body of the granting of rights, privileges, favours, or statuses. It may also imply some obligations to keep those in force. Normally, registration indicates that a fact has a high level of validity because it is formally recognised by an authorised body (like recognising the right of a physician to practice medicine based on a medical degree). 
|
|Registrations are of interest to the modelled organisation because they provide evidence that may be required to process a certain customer request, evidence that may be required by the modelled organisation to provide coverage, and so on.

|The ACTIVITY package makes it possible to define the various activities of interest to a modelled organisation, especially those in the underwriting and claims management areas. 
|During the underwriting process, the modelled organisation needs to understand its exposed risk, based on the activities performed by the insured, either professionally or privately. 
|For example, an insurance company may decide not to cover certain occupations or hobbies or may request an additional premium for the added risk. 
|During the claims management process, the modelled organisation needs to understand the circumstances that surround the loss event resulting in a claim. Activities describe what the different parties were doing at the time of the loss event. The activities are validated against the conditions defined in the insurance agreement, with the result that the claim may not be paid if the conditions are not met.

This modelling describes both the information that is required about these conditions and their relevance to financial services operations; for example, underwriting and claims management.

|A condition can apply to places (for example, the pollution of a beach), human beings (for example, a person having a broken leg), physical objects (for example, a dented car) and social activities (for example, a cancelled sports event).

|Payments due model accounts receivable as well as accounts payable (the main difference is the fact that for accounts receivable, the modelled organisation is the receiver, whereas for accounts payable the modelled organisation is the payer) and are created at the appropriate point in time by the MONEY PROVISION package. 
|
|Outbound payments (for example, the payment of a claim to a customer) result from the accounts payable, whereas inbound payments (for example, a customer paying his premium) are created by recording of the physical money transaction as registered by a bank.

|The MONEY PROVISION package makes it possible to identify monetary amounts outside the context of billing and accounting that are likely to become payable to or by the modelled organisation. 
|The model of the MONEY PROVISION package, therefore, makes it possible to define how much money can be payable, by whom and to whom, and how the payments will be scheduled over time when the money becomes payable. 
|
|The MONEY PROVISION package therefore serves as an interface from the insurance-related packages such as PRODUCT and AGREEMENT, CONTRACT, ACTIVITY, and CLAIM to the financial packages such as FINANCIAL TRANSACTION and ACCOUNT.

|The SPECIFICATION, PRODUCT and AGREEMENT package makes it possible to model financial services products and to define how financial services agreements are created and maintained based on the definition of a product. 
|An agreement specification indicates the type of product or product component on which the policy or policy component is based. It maintains an inventory of products, coverages, and so on. 
|
|An agreement represents a mutual understanding between two or more parties, each committing themselves to fulfil one or more obligations. Each agreement is associated with an agreement specification. 
|
|Typically, an agreement is a financial services agreement or a component thereof (for example, coverage, savings or loan) at any stage in its life-cycle. This includes an agreement from its proposal and issue to its maturity, expiration, or other termination. 
|
|An agreement can also represent an intermediary agreement with the modelled organisation, as in an agency contract or a brokerage contract or an employment agreement between the modelled organisation and an employee.

|The objective of the PHYSICAL OBJECT package is to define physical objects such as cars, houses, human bodies, or any grouping of these from a risk and claims management perspective. 
|
|All physical objects can be covered by an insurance policy, excluded from insurance, or involved in a claim, are modelled in the PHYSICAL OBJECT package. Physical objects can also be used as collateral in financial services agreement (like a house in a mortgage for example). 
|
|In addition to specific physical objects, the PHYSICAL OBJECT package also makes it possible to specify models of physical objects, such as vehicle models. Information about different models and makes of car can be maintained independently of the information about the actual cars insured.

|The LEGAL ACTION package makes it possible to model legal actions and other types of disputes in which the modelled organisation is involved. 
|A legal action represents a process of having a court of law (or any recognised arbitration body) render judgement on a dispute between two parties or groups of parties. This includes criminal and civil cases. This may be caused by non-fulfilment of a delivery of financial liability, service, or goods or by the breaking of an agreement between two or more parties. 
|
|Disputes may be resolved by an independent arbitrator appointed by the insurance companies involved, or by a court care. Disputes may arise for different reasons, but very often are related to claims; for example, when the liability of a claim is disputed, when a subrogation is issued, when financial obligations are not met, or when the cost of a service is disputed

|The CATEGORY package makes it possible to model a dynamic categorisation of the objects in the business model (businessModelObjects) by defining sets of objects and by allowing an object to belong to multiple sets at a time.

|Provides services to support the activities of re-insurance and co-insurance as part of the risk management process. As there is no one-to-one mapping between the business services of co-insurance and re-insurance, they have been detailed separately. A re-insurance agreement is an agreement by which an insurance company covers itself against particular risk. Re-insurance agreements includes re-insurance treaties, facultative re-insurance, quota share, and excess of loss. A co-insurance agreement is an agreement by which several insurance companies decide to share the same risk, every company being liable for a predefined percentage and entitled to receive premiums based on that same predefined percentage.

		documentation 	
|Provides services needed to support the appraisal of a risk on contracts (both new and in force) to determine acceptance, alteration, or rejection of the proposed risk. Underwriting has both an objective aspect and a subjective aspect: 
|
| - The objective aspect is eligibility, which refers principally to preset product rules such as age of insured, minimum premium to be paid, minimum duration of a contract, and a defined claim experience. Services related to this objective aspect will mostly be found in the Rule business components and referenced during the definition using the Financial Service Product component.  
| - The subjective aspect is desirability. Common in commercial lines, this relates to the subjective appreciation of risks in light of factors such as competition, new types of risk where there is no claim experience; for example risks, related to new technologies.   
|Some insurance companies handle these two types of underwriting through different roles, subjective underwriting being handled separately by experienced underwriters and objective underwriting being handled by a system.
