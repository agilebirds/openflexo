CrazyBeans README
-----------------

The distribution classes should all be precompiled and ready for
use. After unpacking you should see the following directories:

api-docs/	Contains the javadoc documentation
cb/		Contains the packages
doc/		Contains documentation for the Petal file grammar
		and the API
examples/	Some example Rose model files
templates/	Serialized classes used as templates
test/		Some test classes
images/		Some images for the PetalTree class

INSTALLATION
------------

CrazyBeans is written entirely in Java (JDK 1.2 or better) and comes
precompiled, so it should be fairly straightforward to get it set up
and running in your environment. Just set your CLASSPATH variable to
the appropiate value, e.g. on UNIX system using the (t)csh

	setenv CLASSPATH $HOME/CrazyBeans:$CLASSPATH

TESTING IT
----------

Within the CrazyBeans directory try

	make check

and
	make test

DOS users without make, just do

	cd test
	java test.Test1 > Test1.mdl
	java test.Test2
	java test.Test2 ..\examples\uni.mdl

Try to read the generated file test/Test1.mdl into Rose (I will not
claim that this model is realistic ... :-). You'll probably have to
use the Tools/Layout Diagram menu too see the diagram correctly. The
sources generated by the second test program should be found in /tmp,
or C:\TEMP respectively, they show one possible way of how to map a
class diagram to (Java) source files. The way can be adapted by subclassing
the Generator and/or Factory class.

You may want to take a look at the sources and the documentation now...

COMPILATION
-----------

If you want to recompile CrazyBeans from scratch for some reason,
you'll need JavaCC:

	http://www.webgain.com/products/metamata/java_doc.html

If you want to use the XMI converter, you'll also need the NSUML package:

	http://nsuml.sourceforge.net/

If you don't have Jikes installed
(http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/)
run
	make JC=javac JFLAGS=

otherwise just run

	make

PROBLEMS
--------

If you get an exception like "serialized version incompatible", run

	make templates

and try again.
