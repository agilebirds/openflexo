The ViewPoint Modeller allows to design a ViewPoint using dedicated graphical 
user interfaces.<br>

This module is dedicated to domain-specific expert users, to model their own view points, 
by formally associating concepts defined in various meta-models (ontologies) with graphical representation rules 
and basic actions to manipulate these concepts and their graphical representations in a domain-specific graphical editor.
