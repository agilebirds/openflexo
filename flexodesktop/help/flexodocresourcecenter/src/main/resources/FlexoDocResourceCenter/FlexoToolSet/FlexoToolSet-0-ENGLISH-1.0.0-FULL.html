    Denali bridges de gap between Business and IT with its Flexo Tool Set, 
    i.e. a family of three products centered around the <i>Flexo Business 
    Process Model</i>:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Flexo Business:</b> This is a <i>Process Modelling and Management </i>software 
        designed for Business managers, analysts and users. Flexo Business 
        allows them to shape their dreams into autonomously built prototypes 
        by graphically defining the underlying business processes and their 
        interaction with human actors and/or external services. Real 
        prototypes and precise documentations are generated for validation and 
        change management without the help of IT specialists.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Flexo Server:</b> This is a <i>collaborative application</i> that 
        allows the Flexo Business users to share Flexo models, to work 
        concurrently on the same model and to autonomously generate prototypes 
        and documentation. With the Flexo Serve you can mix automatically 
        generated documentation with manually written documentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Flexo Enterprise:</b> This has been <i>designed for IT developers</i>. 
        It is the holy grail of model-driven development. Developers receive 
        generated code from the model. They work on it with their usual 
        development tools and their manual contribution is analyzed and 
        automatically re-input into the model to be taken into account in the 
        next iteration of code generation
      </li>
    </ul>
