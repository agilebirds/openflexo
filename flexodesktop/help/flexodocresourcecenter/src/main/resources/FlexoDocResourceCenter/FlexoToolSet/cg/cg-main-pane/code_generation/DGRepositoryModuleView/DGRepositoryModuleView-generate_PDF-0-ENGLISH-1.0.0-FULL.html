    Generate a PDF can only be done with a LaTeX compiler installed on your 
    machine. If you want, you can inform Flexo where to find this compiler in 
    the Doc generator preferences. On PC, most of users can use the 'texify 
    command' while on Mac OS, the command 'pdflatex' should be used.
