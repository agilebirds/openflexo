    This action refreshes all your resources (create new ones, update existing 
    ones and optionally removes irrelevant files). This action should be used 
    most of the times because it is the safest one to make sure that 
    everything is up-to-date. Other actions are there for experts that want to 
    use a fine-tuned behavior of the doc generator (consume less resources, 
    but can cause out-of-synch problems).
