    A <i>display action</i> displays a screen that is somewhere in the process 
    flow. It does not make the instance of the process to advance. It is 
    linked to a button or mostly a hyperlink in the associated screen of the 
    operation.

<i>Display actions </i>do not follow the normal flow of the Petri network. 
    They do not send any token but usually switch the focus to a very 
    different process. Display actions are so called because they allow to 
    switch to, and therefore display, a screen associated with another 
    sub-process.
