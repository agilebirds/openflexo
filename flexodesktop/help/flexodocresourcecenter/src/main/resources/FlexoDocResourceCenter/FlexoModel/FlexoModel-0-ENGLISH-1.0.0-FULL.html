    The<i> Flexo model</i> uses a special kind of graph called a <i>Petri 
    Network</i> for modelling the temporal organization of activities and 
    tasks. The Petri network is an oriented graph that represents activities 
    or tasks as nodes connected by links or arcs. The Petri network nodes are 
    elements that are fired, i.e. become <i>activated</i>, by the arrival of 
    tokens on preconditions associated with their incoming links. An activated 
    node can then be <i>executed</i>, i.e. tokens are sent through its 
    outgoing arcs forward to the next nodes. This allows the modelling of 
    temporal interactions in a very intuitive way.<br><br><img src="Figures/workflowBegin3.jpg"><br><br>Example 
    of a Petri network with three activities. Activity &quot;B&quot; can be activated 
    either by a token arriving from activity &quot;A&quot; or from another one arriving 
    from activity &quot;C&quot;.<br><br>

    <ol>
      <li>
        The first level is for <b>&quot;Activities&quot;</b>: An activity 
        regroups a set of contiguous tasks associated with an identical <i>role</i>, 
        i.e. a group of users with a precise function. The activities take the 
        colors of their associated roles (none in the previous figure which 
        had <i>No Role </i>associated with the activities.

      </li>
      <li>
        The second level can be accessed by double clicking on an activity of 
        the first level. This is the level of &quot;<b>Operations</b>&quot; that 
        models the sequence of elementary tasks performed by the user 
        associated with the activity.An operation is often associated with a 
        screen that accesses and interacts with Business data.Operations may 
        also not depend on any human interactions but be associated with 
        automatically performed computation steps called <i>Self-executed 
        Petri node.</i>

          Instead of going to the next activity, the links are here connected 
          to the &quot;BEGIN&quot; operations of the associated operation level. At the 
          end, when the &quot;END&quot; operation is reached, the token are sent forward 
          to the next activity in the upper level, &quot;END&quot; activity in this case.

      </li>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <li>
        The third level contains the &quot;<b>Actions</b>&quot; that model the 
        interaction with users (clicking on active elements in the screen such 
        as hyperlinks, buttons, icons etc.) or with other applications or 
        process. <img src="Figures/threeLevels.jpg">

    The Flexo model also features the notion of <i>Events</i> that react to 
    external signals (e.g. arrival of an email) or internal timers and 
    propagate tokens. More info on all these concepts in the associated help 
    topics.
