    Sub-processes are associated with process instances and variables that 
    defines the embedded Business data.<br><br>There are three types of 
    sub-processes:

    <ol>
      <li>
        The <b>single sub-process </b>regroups a set of activities that share 
        the same Business data. They act as subroutines and can be replaced by 
        their set of activities.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>parallel sub-process</b> executes several copies or instances 
        of the sequence of activities in parallel. Parallel sub-processes 
        create embedded business data context that can be different for every 
        instance executed in parallel.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>sequential sub-process</b> executes the sequence of activities 
        several times in sequence. Sequential sub-processes create a different 
        embedded data context for each instances performed in sequence.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <i>Sub-process </i>are themselves <i>Activities </i>that monitor their 
    associated instances in <i>management dashboards </i>in their operation 
    level.<br><br><img src="Figures/dashboardworkflow.jpg" width="274" height="213"><br><br>These 
    screens provide a general view on what is going on in the sub-process 
    instances. Basic management dashboards consist usually in process instance 
    lists with search and filter options.<br><br><img src="Figures/dashboard.jpg" width="376" height="146"><br>Clicking 
    on the &quot;+&quot; sign opens the process instance level with the assiociated 
    subsequences of activities and embedded subprocesses with the two ports 
    New and Delete respectively creating and deleting the associated process 
    instance.<br><img src="Figures/portsconnection.jpg" width="300" height="178"><br>
