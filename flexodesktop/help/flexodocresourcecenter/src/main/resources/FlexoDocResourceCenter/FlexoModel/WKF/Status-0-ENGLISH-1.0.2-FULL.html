Statuses are defined in sub-processes as a linear representation of the 
    differents stages of the process. Statuses are often used in monitoring 
    screen to get an idea of the stagi in which the instance is in the process.
<br>Statuses can be assoiciated with activities, operations and actions.  
    Mostly statuses should only be assoicated with actions.  Because normally 
    it should be an action that makes an instance to advance in the process 
    and does change his status.
