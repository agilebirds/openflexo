    <i>Actions</i> are associated with active elements from an o<i>peration</i>. 
    Actions are the third level of the Flexo Model. <i>Actions</i> are the 
    response to the activation of active elements in the screen associated 
    with the <i>operation</i> (click on an hyperlinks, buttons, icons etc.). 
    Actions are the third level of the Flexo Model.<br>

      <li>
        <p>
          There are three different types of actions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <i>FlexoActions</i> are work flow actions that usually 
            interact with the users and propagate tokens in the Petri network 
            once executed. We usually stay on the same subprocess and move to 
            the next work flow step. The DisplayActions do not follow the 
            normal flow of the Petri network. They do not send any token but 
            usually switch the focus to a very different process.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>DisplayActions</i> are so called because they allow to switch 
            to, and therefore display, a screen associated with another 
            sub-process.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <i>Self-executable actions</i> are similar to FlexoActions. 
            They also follows the normal flow of the Petri network, propagate 
            tokens etc., but they do not interact with the user but are 
            associated with a piece of code that is executed as soon as the 
            action preconditions are met.
