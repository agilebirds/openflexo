    A <i>Role</i> can represent one user, one function or a group of users or 
    operators according to their rights and duties in the process.<br><i>Roles</i> 
    are associated with <i>activities</i> and <i>sub-process activities</i>.<br><br>A 
    <i>color</i> is associated with each Role, this gives an operational view 
    on the access rights and the user management.<br><br>Roles are defined at 
    the process level and are inherited by sub-proceses. (Common Roles are 
    often defined in the ROOT process to be used in all its sub-processes.)
