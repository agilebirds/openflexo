    <i>Actions</i> are associated with active elements from an o<i>peration</i>. 
    Actions are the third level of the Flexo Model. <i>Actions</i> are the 
    response to the activation of active elements in the screen associated 
    with the <i>operation</i> (click on an hyperlinks, buttons, icons etc.). 
    Actions are the third level of the Flexo Model.<br>

    <p>
      There are three different types of <i>actions</i>:

    <ul>
      <li>
        The <b><i>FlexoActions</i></b> are work flow actions that usually 
        interact with the users and propagate tokens in the Petri network once 
        executed. We usually stay on the same subprocess and move to the next 
        work flow step. The DisplayActions do not follow the normal flow of 
        the Petri network. They do not send any token but usually switch the 
        focus to a very different process.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b><i>DisplayActions</i></b> are so called because they allow to 
        switch to, and therefore display, a screen associated with another 
        sub-process.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b><i>Self-executable actions</i></b> are similar to FlexoActions. 
        They also follows the normal flow of the Petri network, propagate 
        tokens etc., but they do not interact with the user but are associated 
        with a piece of code that is executed as soon as the action 
        preconditions are met.
      </li>
    </ul>
