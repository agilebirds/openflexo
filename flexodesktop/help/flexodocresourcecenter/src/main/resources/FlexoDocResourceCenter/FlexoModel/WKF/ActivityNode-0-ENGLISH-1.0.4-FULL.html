    according to their associated roles. All the tasks performed within an <i>activity</i> 
    are performed by the same <i>role</i>. A <i>role</i> can be a person or 
    function within the organisation. Activities take the color from their 
    associated operator role.<br><i>Activities</i> are a group of <i>operations</i> 
    which are sequenced tasks operated by the same role. A <i>status</i> can 
    be given to an activity. The status that you give is the status of the 
    process instance when it leaves the process.<br><br>
