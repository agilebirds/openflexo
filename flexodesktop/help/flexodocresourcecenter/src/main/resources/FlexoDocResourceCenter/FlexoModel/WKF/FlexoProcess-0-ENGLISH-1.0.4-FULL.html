    Sub-processes are sub-sequences of activities or sub-processes that can be 
    used at different places in the workflow. Sub-processes are associated 
    instances and variables that contain Business data.<br><br>The Flexo model 
    encourages the modularity and the reusability by the notion of 
    sub-processes, i.e. sub-sequences of activities or sub-processes that can 
    be reused at different place in the workflow. Subprocesses are organized 
    in a hierarchy. Each sub-process has a father sub-process from which it 
    inherits variables, role and status definition.<br><br>There are three 
    types of sub-processes:

    <ol>
      <li>
        The <b>single sub-process </b>regroups a set of activities. They act 
        as subroutines and can be replaced by its set of activities.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>parallel sub-process</b> executes several copies of the 
        sequence of activities in parallel. Parallel sub-processes create 
        embedded business data context that can be different for every 
        instance executed in parallel.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>sequential sub-process</b> executes the sequence of activities 
        several times in sequence. Sequential sub-processes create a different 
        embedded data context for each instances performed in sequence.
      </li>
    </ol>
