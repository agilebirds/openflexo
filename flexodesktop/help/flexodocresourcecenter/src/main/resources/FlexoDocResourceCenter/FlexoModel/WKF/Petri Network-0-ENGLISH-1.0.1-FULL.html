    The <i>Petri network</i> nodes are elements that are fired, i.e. become <i>activated</i>, 
    by the arrival of <i>tokens</i> on <i>preconditions</i> associated with 
    their <i>incoming links</i>. An activated node can then be <i>executed</i>, 
    i.e. tokens are sent through its <i>outgoing edges</i> forward to the next <i>nodes</i>. 
    <i>TokenEdge</i> can have <i>delays</i> associated with the transfer of 
    tokens. This allows the modelling of temporal interactions in a very 
    intuitive way.<br><br><img src="Figures/workflowBegin3.jpg"><br><br>Example 
    of a Petri network with three activities. Activity &quot;B&quot; can be activated 
    either by a token arriving from activity &quot;A&quot; or from another one arriving 
    from activity &quot;C&quot;.<br>
