Sub-process Activity Nodes are activities that are sub-processes and they 
    are linked to a sub-process.
Several Sub-Process Activity Nodes can be linked to the same Sub-process.

There are three types of sub-processes:

    <ol>
      <li>
        The <b>single sub-process </b>regroups a set of activities. They act 
        as subroutines and can be replaced by their set of activities.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>parallel sub-process</b> executes several copies of the 
        sequence of activities in parallel. Parallel sub-processes create 
        embedded business data context that can be different for every 
        instance executed in parallel.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>sequential sub-process</b> executes the sequence of activities 
        several times in sequence. Sequential sub-processes create a different 
        embedded data context for each instances performed in sequence.
      </li>
    </ol>
