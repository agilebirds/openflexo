    The <i>Petri network</i> nodes are elements that are fired, i.e. become <i>activated</i>, 
    by the arrival of <i>tokens</i> on <i>preconditions</i> associated with 
    their <i>incoming links</i>. An activated node can then be <i>executed</i>, 
    i.e. tokens are sent through its <i>outgoing edges</i> forward to the next <i>nodes</i>.
