    A radio button can take only two values (true or false - checked or 
    unchecked). A radio button is used in a group of at least 2 radio buttons.<br><br>A 
    radio button is used to choose just one single item in a list of at least 
    two elements. So radio buttons have to be linked to each other. They need 
    the same group name. (To specify in inspector.)<br><br>Warning: it is very 
    important to notice that a specific group name has to be set for each 
    radio button group in order to avoid any bad radio button behaviour. Don't 
    let this group name field with 'groupName' value and change it to a 
    specific value for each radio button group.<br>
