    A <i>workflow</i> organizes the flow of activities performed by the human <i>end 
    users</i> and the <i>machines</i>. A process is composed of sub-processes 
    and activities.

    <ul>
      <li>
        A sub-process is mostly a parallel sub-process. This means that you 
        have different flows running in parallel through your process. (e.g. 
        in the package delivery process of a delivery company, you have many 
        packages being delivered at the same time).
      </li>
      <li>
        Process screens are mostly managing lists of flow instances (e.g. the 
        list of packages being delivered for the delivery company) but can 
        also be used as Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dashboards or 
        management cockpits.
      </li>
      <li>
        A role is also associated with a process, meaning that a person from a 
        given group of users is responsible for the process.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A workflow is organized as three levels of Petri network:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Activity level:</b>

        <p>
          An activity is also associated with a role, thus a person or a group 
          of persons having the same role. An activity is a set of operations 
          done by one single role. Users can belong to several roles.
        </p>
        An activity is composed of operations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Operation Level:</b>

        <p>
          The operations level models the sequence of elementary tasks 
          performed by the end users associated with the activity. Tasks from 
          this operation level are mostly associated with screens for 
          interaction with human users (&#12;ll in forms, advance in the process, 
          etc.) but can also be associated with self-executable nodes (i.e. 
          triggering automatically performed computation steps) without any 
          associated screens.
        </p>
        An operation is composed of action
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Action level:</b>

        <p>
          The action level is the interaction level. One the one hand, actions 
          can be associated with screen buttons, hyperlinks, icons, etc. to 
          interact with the user and make him/her move in the process, change 
          the status of his/her &#12;le, etc. (see Section 5.8 for more details). 
          On the other hand, actions can be associated with code function 
          calls for interacting with legacy applications and/or performing 
          some particular computation. There are three different types of 
          actions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <i>FlexoActions</i> are work flow actions that usually 
            interact with the users and propagate tokens in the Petri network 
            once executed. We usually stay on the same subprocess and move to 
            the next work flow step. The DisplayActions do not follow the 
            normal flow of the Petri network. They do not send any token but 
            usually switch the focus to a very different process.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>DisplayActions</i> are so called because they allow to switch 
            to, and therefore display, a screen associated with another 
            sub-process.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <i>Self-executable actions</i> are similar to FlexoActions. 
            They also follows the normal flow of the Petri network, propagate 
            tokens etc., but they do not interact with the user but are 
            associated with a piece of code that is executed as soon as the 
            action preconditions are met.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Events level:</b>

        <p>
          The Flexo model also features the notion of Events that react to 
          external signals (e.g. arrival of an email) or internal timers by 
          propagating token to their outgoing arcs. <i>Events</i> can be added 
          at any level.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
