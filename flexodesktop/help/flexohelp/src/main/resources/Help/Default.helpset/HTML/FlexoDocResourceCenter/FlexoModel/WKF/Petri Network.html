    A Petri Network is a graph whose nodes are active elements that are fired 
    by the arrival of tokens on their incoming links or edges. Once executed, 
    the nodes sends tokens through their outgoing edges forward to the next 
    nodes. TokenEdge can have delays associated with the transfer of tokens.
