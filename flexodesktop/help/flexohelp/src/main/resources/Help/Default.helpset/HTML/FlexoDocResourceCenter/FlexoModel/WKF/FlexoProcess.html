    The Flexo model encourages the modularity and the reusability by the 
    notion of subprocesses, i.e. sub-sequences of activities or sub-processes 
    that can be reused at different place in the workflow. Subprocesses are 
    organized in a hierarchy. Each subprocess has a father sub-process from 
    which it inherits variables, role and status definition. There are three 
    types of sub-processes:

    <ol>
      <li>
        The <b>simple sub-process </b>regroups a set of activities. They acts 
        a subroutines and could be replaced by its set of activities.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>parallel sub-process</b> executes several copies of the 
        sequence of activities in parallel. Parallel sub-processes create 
        embedded business data context that can be different for every 
        instance executed in parallel.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>sequential sub-process</b> executes the sequence of activities 
        several times in sequence. Sequential sub-processes create a different 
        embedded data context for each instances performed in sequence.
      </li>
    </ol>
