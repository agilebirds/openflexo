	<h2>A free implementation of an XML COder/DEcoder:<br>a Java XML serialization/deserialization tool</h2>
      </center>
      
	
	<p>This package provides tools for easily and automatically serializing/deserializing Java objects 
    to/from XML strings or streams. It provides a way to easily implement an XML persistent object model.
    It features support for a scheme for accessors methods use, support for an advanced inheritance scheme, 
    native support for array, vector, and hashtable data structures, as well as native support to 
    serialize/deserialize graph structures (cross-referenced objects).</p>

	download on <a href="http://picolibre.enst-bretagne.fr/projects/xmlcode/">picolibre.enst-bretagne.fr/projects/xmlcode/</a></p>
	
	<p>Since this version, this library has been enhanced by many new powerfull features including:
	<ul>
	   <li>Support for graph-structure serialization/deserialization</li>
	   <li>Support for builders and finalizers</li>
	   <li>Support for using XMLCoDe as XML generator</li>
	   <li>Many other new features, see <a href="features.html">Detailed review and discussion of main features</a></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Version 1.0 including all those new features has been released under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">Lesser GPL licence</a>

      <h2><a name="main_features"/>Main features</h2>
      
      <ul>
	
	<li><p>This package provides tools for automatically serializing and 
	    deserializing Java objects to/from XML strings and streams. In 
	    other words, this package provides a way to easily implement a
	    XML-persistant object model.
	  </p></li>
	<li><p>These operations are processed in a very easy and efficient 
	    manner, without need to specify anything else.
	  </p></li>
	<li><p>Any object could be handled by this package, since
	    objects need only implement an empty interface XMLSerializable.
	  </p></li>
	<li><p>To implement this, you need to define a external mapping model, where 
	    the mapping between Java world and XML tags should be defined
	    (you should also decide which data you want to serialize, in
	    order to get a consistent model).<br>
	    See <a href="../javadoc/index.html">package documentation</a>
	    and example 1 for more explanations on that process. Soon an 
	    'how-to' documentation.
	  </p></li>
	<li><p>This package supports an advanced object inheritance scheme.<br>
	      See example 2 to show those issues.
	  </p></li>
	<li><p>This package supports accessors methods use scheme, which 
	    allow you to automatically maintain a consistent object model.<br>
	      See examples 1 & 2 to show those issues.
	  </p></li>
	<li><p>Advanced data structures vector and hashtable are natively 
	    supported.<br>
	      See example 2 to show examples of those data structures.
	  </p></li>
	<li><p>Other custom data structures could be easily supported 
	    through use of accessors methods. (NB: those developpements are
	    welcome to enhance the current XMLCoDe version).
	  </p></li>
        <li><p>This package works with/over parser and transformer 
	  softwares.<br>
	  <i>NOTA:  This distribution comes with an implementation of
	    a parser software (JAXP1.1) and a transformer (Apache Xalan 
	    Transformer) but you can easily change this for other software.</i>

     		that in some cases, serialization results are not really human-readable. Furthermore, 
     		in the context of concurrent modifications (CVS context), conflicts resolution is difficult
     		as serialized structure is not stable. This document deals with a way to ensume stable

     		<p>When trying to work in a collaborative context, some problems may arise because identifiers used by
    		XMLCoDe may change (and be unstable) as they are internally allocated by XMLCoDe. This document explain

    <p>The binary distribution is released as a jar file containing classes
    defined in fr.enstb.xmlcode package (contains XMLCoder, XMLDecoder and XMLMapping classes).</p>

    <p>If your Java
    environment does not contain DOM-model nor JDOM-model, you might want to use following provided jars 
    <a href="../distribution/lib/crimson.jar">crimson.jar</a> (see <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/">http://www.w3.org/DOM/</a>) 
    and <a href="../distribution/lib/jdom-1.0.jar">jdom-1.0.jar</a>
    (see <a href="http://www.jdom.org/">http://www.jdom.org/</a>)</p>
 
    <p>To run examples you also may need JUnit library, also available with this software here: 
    <a href="../distribution/lib/junit-3.8.1.jar">junit-3.8.1.jar</a>.</p>
