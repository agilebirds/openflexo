    <p>This package provides classes and interfaces used in the context
    of resources management for a Flexo project.<p>
    
    The global resource management is performed by a unique
    instance of {@link org.openflexo.foundation.rm.FlexoResourceManager}. This instance is pointing on a {@link org.openflexo.foundation.rm.FlexoProject} 
    instance, which contains general data, such as project directory, and multiple instances of
    {@link org.openflexo.foundation.rm.FlexoResource}.
